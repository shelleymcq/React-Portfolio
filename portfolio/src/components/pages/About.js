            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have always taken a nontraditional path, slogging through night classes while working as a database manager during the day, transferring to UC Berkeley to earn my physical science and teaching degrees, and now reinventing myself as a full stack web developer. As a teacher, I pursued every learning opportunity to grow my skills and embrace new technologies. My drive to learn influenced me to become a web creator and broaden my scope of impact. As a student in a full stack coding bootcamp, I have reignited my passion for learning, quickly gaining technology skills to build websites, dig into documentation, and test code to understand the function and syntax of every single line. My science teaching experience has honed my ability to communicate, collaborate, and manage learners of all levels. I want a role that leverages both my tech and teaching skills to create applications and experiences for learners and information seekers who want to make the world, and web, a more beautiful and accessible place to learn.</p>
            <p>Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I moved to Atlanta for a job teaching chemistry. I loved it enough that I thought I might be able to handle the summer heat for at least a couple years. Then I discovered Dragon Con, the amazing Georgia State Parks, and a group of nerdy friends. That was 2010. Summer is still too hot, but it's an OK trade. And since I'm completing the Georgia Tech Full Stack Certification Bootcamp virtually, I can avoid the worst of the heat.</p>
